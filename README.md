# chess

This is an implementation of a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
Currently the code provided has a constant search depth of 5 but I plan to modify it to change the depth as the match progresses. 

## Usage

``` 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This should give you all the necessary libraries. You also need to have jupyter notebook setup to use this.
